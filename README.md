Comments - I love the simple design with just a couple of buttons make everything very simple and easy for a user. It reminds me of an old retro game! However, I do believe you could have added maybe a little bit of more detail instead of just black text. I noticed the rules tab has a white background instead of the usual green but that might be by design. Your logic and games work as intended, I could not find any issues with that. Good job overall!
